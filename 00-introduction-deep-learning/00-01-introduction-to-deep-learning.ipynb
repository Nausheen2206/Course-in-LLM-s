    "# What is Deep Learning?\n",
    "*Deep Learning* is a subfield of Machine Learning that uses algorithms called Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). These networks are inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. Deep learning models are capable of learning complex patterns automatically from large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Idea of Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea of Deep Learning is to enable machines to **automatically learn hierarchical and meaningful features from raw data** using multiple layers of Artificial Neural Networks, eliminating the need for manual feature extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because deep learning models contain many hidden layers, the learning process is referred to as *deep* learning. Each layer learns increasingly abstract representations of the input data.\n",

    "**Figure:**  \n",
    "Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning is a specialized subset of Machine Learning that uses deep neural networks.\n",
    "## Evolution from Artificial Intelligence to Machine Learning to Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** was the starting point.  \n",
    "In AI, machines were programmed using fixed rules written by humans. The system could act intelligent, but it could not learn on its own. Any change required rewriting the rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning (ML)** came next.  \n",
    "Instead of writing rules manually, machines started learning from data. Humans still guided the process by selecting important features, but the system could improve its performance by learning patterns from examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deep Learning (DL)** is the latest stage of this evolution.  \n",
    "Deep learning systems learn directly from raw data using multi-layer neural networks. They automatically find features, understand complex patterns, and improve with experience, requiring very little human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In simple terms:**  \n",
    "AI → Humans tell the machine *what to do*  \n",
    "ML → Humans give data and help the machine *learn*  \n",
    "DL → The machine *learns by itself* from large amounts of data\n"

    "## Typical Workflow of a Deep Learning System\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Acquisition\n",
    "Data acquisition is the process of collecting data needed to solve a problem. Deep learning models require large amounts of data to learn effectively. The data can come from various sources such as public datasets, company databases, web scraping, or manual labeling by humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good quality data is very important because the performance of a deep learning model depends heavily on the data it is trained on. If the data is noisy, biased, or insufficient, the model will not perform well.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "Data preprocessing prepares raw data so that it can be used by a deep learning model. Real-world data is often incomplete, inconsistent, and unstructured.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step includes cleaning missing or incorrect values, scaling or normalizing numerical features, and converting categorical or text data into a numerical format. Proper preprocessing improves training speed and helps the model learn meaningful patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Splitting the Data\n",
    "After preprocessing, the data is divided into different sets. The training set is used to teach the model, the validation set is used to evaluate performance during training, and sometimes a test set is used for final evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step helps in checking whether the model is learning well or just memorizing the data. Handling class imbalance is also done here to ensure fair learning across all classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Build and Train Model\n",
    "In this step, the deep learning model is designed and trained. The model architecture defines the number of layers, type of layers, and how data flows through the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, the model learns by making predictions, comparing them with actual values, and adjusting its internal weights to reduce errors. Training usually requires multiple iterations and significant computational power.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Evaluate Performance\n",
    "Once training is complete, the model’s performance is evaluated using validation or test data. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or loss are chosen based on the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step helps determine whether the model is reliable and ready for real-world use. Poor performance indicates that the model needs further improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "If the model performance is not satisfactory, hyperparameter tuning is performed. This involves adjusting values such as learning rate, batch size, number of layers, or activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization techniques may be added to reduce overfitting. This step is often repeated multiple times until acceptable performance is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Deployment\n",
    "Deployment is the final step where the trained model is made available for real-world applications. The model is hosted on servers or cloud platforms and integrated into applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step also includes handling input data, generating predictions, managing software dependencies, and monitoring model performance after deployment. Once deployed, the model can be used by users or systems in real time.\n",
